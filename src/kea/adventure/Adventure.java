                                   --  Adventure (part 1) --

DAT21 Java project (compulsory group exercise).
 Developers: Graham Heaven and Lasse BÃ¸geskov-Jensen, September 2021.

A simple text-based adventure game inspired by "Colossal Cave Adventure",
 by William Crowther and Don Woods, from 1976-1977.

A single player navigates through a small maze of rooms using a simple text parser interface.
In each room it is possible to get limited information about the room, and move to connected rooms.
There is an achievable goal using the available commands.
