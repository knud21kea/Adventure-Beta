                                                   --  Adventure (version 2.0) --
                DAT21 Java project (compulsory group exercise).
                 Developers: Graham Heaven and Lasse BÃ¸geskov-Jensen, September 2021.
                A simple text-based adventure game inspired by "Colossal Cave Adventure",
                 by William Crowther and Don Woods, from 1976-1977.
                 
                Version 1.1:
                A single player navigates through a small maze of rooms using a simple text parser interface.
                In each room it is possible to get limited information about the room, and move to connected rooms.
                There is an achievable goal using the available commands.
                                
                Change log for version 1.2:
                Added items that can be carried from room to room, dropped or taken.
                Added strength points that are lost by doing actions and gained by resting.
                Added weights to items.
                Added max carrying weight for player, meaning sometimes something must be dropped to take something else.
                Added more commands: Inventory player, Inventory room, Take item, Drop item, Show cheat sheet.
                Added mission that requires successful combination of available commands. Player can also die in 2 different ways.
                Added music class
                Added context colours for text
                                
                Change log for version 1.3:
                Added food as extension to item, with both positive and negative food values
                Added Weapon as an extension to item, with sub-classes meleeWeapon and shootingWeapon
                Added Enemy as new class with ability to equip weapons and use them
                Added combat system
                Added commands: Eat, Attack
                Added documentation
                
                Change log for version 2.0:
                Added Controller
                Added User Interface
                Added enums
                Improved low coupling
